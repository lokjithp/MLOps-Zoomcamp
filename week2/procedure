This week is all about Experiment tracking!

It's required for reproducability of our own experiments so that we can refer it later!
This also helps to keep track of our hyperparameters!

We can actually do it in a spreadsheet like for each experiments, store it's accuracy and results etc. but this is not simple and might be error prone  and for colloboration 
purposes, it's difficult to work on something together etc and hence the reason there're standard architectures that are developed to track our machine learning
experiments!


MLFlow is a python package for ml life cycle!

python3>>>pip install mlflow
